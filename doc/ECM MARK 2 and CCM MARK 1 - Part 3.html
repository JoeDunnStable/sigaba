307. <b>ZEROIZING.</b>
<p>
(a) The process of turning the Code Wheels so that each one is set with the
letter "O" opposite
the white reference lines is called "Zeroizing", and when the Code Wheels
are all set, it is called
the "Zeroize position". All processes (except special methods of operation)
start from the
Zeroize position.
<p>
(b) To Zeroize:
<p></p>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr valign="top"><td>
(1) Set the Controller at "R" (Reset). The motor should start as soon as
the Controller is turned

"Zeroize".
<p>
(3) Press the "RPT" Key, then the "Blank" Key and hold both keys down. The
Code Wheels will
step until each Code Wheel has reached its zeroize position (i.e., with the
letter "O" opposite the
white reference line) where it will stop.
<p>
NOTE: If each Code Wheel does not step and automatically stop at its
zeroize position, the cause

Wheels if these are available. Code Wheel and Cipher Unit contacts should
be cleaned (see
paragraph 403). If the 26-30 Letter Check cannot be obtained, and the
operator is satisfied

309. <b>CODE WHEEL ALIGNMENT.</b>
<p>
(a) The Code Wheel Alignment is a group of five letters, selected at
random, to which the Code
Wheels of the Stepping Maze (the front row of five Code Wheels) are set
prior to encipherment
(or decipherment).
<p>
(b) This alignment (or reading) of the Code Wheels of the Stepping Maze at
the start of the
actual encipherment is transmitted unenciphered as the INTERNAL INDICATOR
of the message. It
shall be recorded on the message being enciphered for reference purposes in
case a verification
is requested.
<p></p>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr valign="top"><td>
CAUTION: THE CODE WHEEL ALIGNMENT FOR EACH MESSAGE ENCIPHERED BY A
PARTICULAR
KEY SETTING MUST BE DIFFERENT. THE SELECTION OF THE LETTERS MUST BE
ENTIRELY AT
RANDOM, THE LETTERS "O" AND "Z" MUST NOT BE USED, AND THE LETTERS MUST NOT
FOLLOW
A REGULAR SYSTEM OF PROGRESSION. (See paragraph 329).
</td></tr></table>
<p>
(c) To make the Code Wheel alignment:
<p></p>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr valign="top"><td>
(1) Zeroize the Code Wheels, (pan. 307). Set the Controller at "R" (Reset)

"Operate". The left (#1) Code Wheel of the Stepping Maze will step one
letter for each time the
numeral "1" Key is pressed. Press and release this Key the number of times
required to align
#1 Code Wheel to the first letter of the Code Wheel Alignment.
<p>
NOTE: While the Code Wheels of the Stepping Maze are being aligned, the
Code Wheels, of the
Alphabet Maze will also step.

(2) Similarly align, in succession, the second (#2) Code Wheel with the
numeral "2" key, the
third (#3) Code Wheel with the numeral "3" key, etc, until the Code Wheels
of the Stepping
Maze are aligned to the letters chosen.
<p>
CAUTION: The Code Wheels must be aligned in correct sequence. If any Code
Wheel is stepped past
the correct letter or if the Code Wheels are not set in proper sequence,
the entire process must
be re-commenced from the zeroize position.
<p>
(3) Do not use the Repeat Key in this operation, and avoid a "staccato"

322. <b>PARALLEL OPERATION.</b>
<p>
(a) Parallel operation of the ECM is not recommended except in unusual
circumstances.
Experience has shown that the reliable operating speed of the parallel
arrangement is far below
that of a single machine. The two machines tend to "out of step" if this
speed is exceeded. For this
reason, and because general use of parallel operation would require a
number of machines far in
excess of the number available, parallel operation should be kept at a
minimum.
<p>
(b) The following instructions for Parallel Operation are given for
instances in which its use is
authorized.
<p>
323. <b>PREPARATION OF MACHINES FOR PARALLEL OPERATION.</b>
<p>
(a) Both machines must be equipped with motors designed for operation on
the same type power.
<p>
(b) To prepare the machine for parallel operation:
<p></p>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr valign="top"><td>
(1) Determine which machine has the higher speed;
<p></p>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr valign="top"><td>
(A) Prepare each machine for individual operation.
<p>
(B) Set the Controller of both machines to "R", and reset the Counters to
zero.
<p>
(C) Press both "Repeat" Key Levers. Simultaneously press both "Blank"
Keylevers, and hold
them down approximately one minute. Release the Keys simultaneously, and
turn both machines
off.
<p>
(D) Note the Counter readings. The machine with the higher Counter reading
should be used as
<b>the secondary</b> machine (to the right), the machine with the lower Counter
reading should be
used as the <b>master</b> machine (to the left).
</td></tr></table>
<p>
(2) Disconnect the power cord of the secondary machine from the source of
power. (Secure it in
manner which will prevent accidental re-connection).
<p>
(3) Replace the fuses in the master machine with 10 ampere fuses. (This is
necessary because
5 ampere fuses are insufficient to start both motors at the same time. Five
(5) ampere fuses
will work, <b>if</b> the master machine is always started first, <b>then</b> the
secondary machine.
<p>
(4) Place the secondary machine to the right of the master machine. Using

325. <b>EMERGENCY OPERATION.</b>
<p>
(a) To prepare the machine for operation on an emergency power supply of 24
volts, DC:
<p></p>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr valign="top"><td>
(1) Disconnect the power lead.
<p>
(2) Interchange the position of the motor plug (designated "DC" or "AC",
depending upon the
type of motor) and the indicator plug so that the pointer of the indicator
plug points to "24 DC".
See Plate 8c.
<p>
(3) Raise the pawl from the channel ring and slip the channel ring to the
outside, allowing the pawl to engage the ratchet (See Plate 8c).
<p>
(4) Connect the power lead to a source of 24 volts direct current. (See
para. 211(d).)
<p>
(5) Proceed with the normal operation of the machine except, for each Key
lever pressed,
completely depress the emergency hand drive lever once. Make a full down
stroke for each letter
and permit the motor to stop before pressing the next letter. Do <b>not</b> "pump
the handle".
Emergency operation cannot be hurried; it is a slow process.
<p>
CAUTION: HOLD THE KEYLEVER DOWN DURING THE ENTIRE TIME NECESSARY TO
COMPLETE THE
CYCLE. This is most important when making the Code Wheel Alignment.

326. <b>CORRECTION OF ERRORS.</b>
<p>
(a) During encipherment, if the wrong keylever is pressed, that letter only
will be in error.
The decipherment will appear exactly as typed - with a one letter garble. It is
essential that no
attempt be made to correct the actual error other than a complete re-encipherment. The
error may be
ignored, and if the check-decipherment is intelligible without confusion,
leave the one-letter
garble in the text. If desired, the word "ERROR" or the letter "E" repeated
several times, may be
enciphered followed by the last correct word, proceeding with the
encipherment from that
point.
<p>
(b) During decipherment, if the wrong keylever Is pressed, that letter only
will be in error. If
the error is ignored and the decipherment continued, only a one letter
garble will result, and
the text should be easily completed by inspection.
<p>
(c) If the check-decipherment reveals the omission of entire words or
phrases, the best
practice is to re-encipher the text in its entirety.
<p>
(d) In order to check the encipherment or decipherment of a certain portion
of the text or to
recommence decipherment at the point at which a garble occurs:
<p></p>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr valign="top"><td>
(1) Check the first letter of the portion of the text to be checked and
determine the interval
from the beginning of the encipherment (or decipherment) to this letter.
<p>
NOTE: It is recommended that the check be started one or two groups (five
or ten letters) before
the point of the garble to insure that the starting point has been
correctly determined.
<p></p>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr valign="top"><td>
(A) On encipherment, the interval is difficult to determine because it is
necessary to count each
letter of plain text plus the spaces, assuming the original typist did not
make errors. If the
portion to be checked has just been typed, the counter reading may be noted
and the interval
"counted back" and one added to the number thus obtained.
<p>
(B) On decipherment, the interval may be determined from the regular
arrangement of the
cipher groups.
</td></tr></table>
<p>
(2) Zeroize and align the Code Wheels.
<p>
(3) Set the Controller at "E" (Encipher) or "D" (Decipher), according to
the process desired,
leaving the "Zeroizer" at "Operate". Reset the Counter to zero.
<p>
(4) Press the "Repeat" Keylever, then the "Blank" keylever and allow the
Code Wheels to step
until the counter reading approaches the interval previously determined,
then release both
Keylevers. Using the "Blank" keylever step the Code Wheels until the
Counter reading is one less
than the recorded interval.
<p>
NOTE: The paper tape feed can be suppressed by holding the tape release tab
down while the Code
Wheels are being stepped with the "Blank" keylever.
<p>
(5) Record the alignment of <b>all</b> Code Wheels and the Counter reading.
<p>
(6) Proceed with the encipherment (or decipherment) from the letter
previously checked.

(A) If the printed text Is garbled, reset the Code Wheels, by hand, to the

<p>
(B) If the printed text is still garbled, reset the Code Wheels, by hand,
to the alignment
previously recorded and proceed with the encipherment (or decipherment) but
begin one letter
after the letter checked.
<p>
(C) If the text Is still garbled, try adding two letters then subtracting
two letters, etc. until five letters plus or minus have been tried. Failure of correct text to

<p>
328. <b>SPECIAL CHECKING PROCESS FOR "SIMPLE-SUBSTITUTION".</b>
<p>
(a) A mono-alphabetical ("simple-substitution") cipher capable of being
solved by an amateur cryptanalyst can be produced by the ECM if certain operating procedures are
not faithfully
followed by the operator.
<p>
(b) The primary cause of the production of a simple substitution cipher is
the mis-alignment
of an Index or a Code Wheel. If an Index Wheel is not accurately positioned, the
stepping control
circuits to the Code Wheels of the Alphabet Maze will be broken, and the
Code Wheels of the
Alphabet Maze will not step. If a Code Wheel of the Stepping Maze is not
accurately positioned
(generally in Joint Army-Navy method of operation wherein the Code Wheels
are aligned by
hand) the stepping circuits will also be broken. The resultant encipherment
in either case will
be a "simple-substitution".
<p>
(c) The operator can definitely insure against the production of a simple
substitution cipher by
faithfully performing the 26-30 Letter Check, and, when using the U.S. Navy
general method of
operation, checking the alignment of the Code Wheels of the Alphabet Maze
after making the Code
Wheel Alignment to see that all five are not aligned to "O". A machine
capable of producing a
"simple-substitution" encipherment will not give the correct 26-30 Letter
Check, nor will the
check-decipherment, if properly performed, decipher.
<p>
(d) When a message is wholly undecipherable, in order to check the
possibility of its having
been enciphered on a machine improperly adjusted:
<p></p>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr valign="top"><td>
(1) Prepare the machine for operation in the normal manner, except turn any
Index Wheel
between two numbers or remove it entirely.
<p>
(2) Set the Controller at "D" (Decipher) and set the Zeroizer to "Operate".
Reset the counter to
zero.
<p>
(3) (A) If the message was enciphered by the standard U.S. Navy method of
operation, zeroize
the Code Wheels, and leave them aligned to 00000.

(B) If the message was enciphered using the Joint Army-Navy method of

Alignment and decipher the
Internal Indicator to produce the Message Code Wheel Alignment. Align, by

<p></p>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr valign="top"><td>
NOTE: For either method of operation, the Code Wheels of the Stepping Maze
may be ignored
entirely since the mis-alignment of the Index Wheel prevents these Code
Wheels from

reason, when using
either method of operation, a Code Wheel Alignment need not be made on the
Code Wheels of the
Stepping Maze.
</td></tr></table>
</td></tr></table>
(4) Type (decipher) the message. While deciphering, the Code Wheels of the
Alphabet Maze
must remain aligned to the original Code Wheel Alignment (00000 if using
standard Navy
method, or if using the Joint Army-Navy method, the Message Code Wheel
Alignment). If they do
not, it indicates the Index Wheel is making contact.
<p>
(5) RESET THE INDEX WHEEL TO THE CORRECT ALIGNMENT
</td></tr></table>
(e) If the message deciphers properly it indicates the enciphering machine
was operating
incorrectly. The deciphering activity should report, as opportunity
affords, to the enciphering
activity with information to the Chief of Naval Operations any message so
deciphered.
<p>
(f) The deciphering activity must not relay the cipher text of a message
enciphered in the above
manner, but should re-encipher the message. Prior to re-encipherment, the
order of sentences
should be changed. Different indicators and Date-Time Group should be used,
and other standard
re-encipherment practices followed to prevent linkage with the original
message.
<p>
(g) The seriousness of such an encipherment cannot be over-emphasized. A
simple substitution
can result only through carelessness of the operator. THIS CARELESSNESS IS
INEXCUSABLE. The
ECM Mark 2, like any machine, is not fool-proof. Common sense and faithful
observance of
instructions on the part of the operator are essential.
<p>
(h) <b>OPERATORS MUST TAKE CARE TO USE THE ECM PROPERLY.</b>
<p>
329. <b>RANDOM SELECTION OF CODE WHEEL ALIGNMENTS.</b>
<p>
(a) Code Wheel Alignments <b>must</b> be selected at random and any definite
system of progression
must <b>not</b> be followed. Random selection of Code Wheel Alignments is
imperative to insure the
greatest possible variety of starting points. A Code Wheel Alignment which
is not selected at
random is likely to be repeated using the same Key Setting. Two messages
with the same starting
point is a condition sought by cryptanalysts.
<p>
(b) There are several methods which may be employed to produce random Code
Wheel
Alignments:
<p></p>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr valign="top"><td>
(1) Cipher groups may be selected at random from a group of messages.
<p>
(2) An average of one out of ten letters may be deleted from the cipher
groups of a message, and
the letters used consecutively.
<p>
(3) Poker chips or cards may be labled with the letters of the alphabet and
five selected at
random for each setting.
<p>
(4) A cipher machine may be prepared for encipherment using a random Code
Wheel
Arrangement and the keys depressed at random or a cipher message typed.
Letters of the cipher
groups thus produced may be used consecutively for Code Wheel Alignments.
</td></tr></table>
<p>
(c) In each case, the letters "O" and "Z" should be deleted to prevent
accidental use.
<p>
330. <b>MESSAGE LENGTH.</b>
<p>
(a) Very long messages to be enciphered with the ECM Mark 2 should be
broken up into parts,
each of which uses a different Code Wheel Alignment. Each part should not
exceed three-hundred
and fifty (350) groups in length.
<p>
(b) This limitation on message length is imposed, for convenience in
traffic handling and for uniformity of
procedure between the services. The cryptographic security of the ECM is
not involved.
